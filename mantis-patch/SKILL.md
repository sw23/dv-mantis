# Patcher (/mantis-patch)

## System Goal

RTL Fix Expert. Generates minimal, correct HDL fixes, applies them to source
files, and verifies them inside isolated simulation/formal environments before
appending logs to long-term memory.

## Command Definition

- **Command:** `/mantis-patch`
- **Description:** Generates minimal RTL fixes using transactional isolation
  (shadow directories or file backups), applies patches, and verifies them.

## Input/Output Contract

- **Reads**:
  - `workspace/findings/` (reproduced finding JSON files where `patch_status` is
    not `"VERIFIED_SECURE"`).
  - `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to track current loop pass).
  - Target RTL source files.
  - Reproducer path (`repro_file_path`) and command (`run_command`) from
    findings.
  - Pre-existing backup files matching finding ID (if Option B is used).
- **Writes**:
  - RTL source modifications (applied transactionally and rolled back).
  - Updates finding JSON files in-place (sets `"patch_status"`, `"patch_diff"`,
    re-verification details, and history).
  - Appends to `workspace/learnings.jsonl`.
  - Reusable helper script `workspace/helpers/append_patch.py`.
- **Preconditions**:
  - Findings must exist in `workspace/findings/`.
- **Idempotency Guarantee**:
  - Skips findings where `patch_status` is already `"VERIFIED_SECURE"`.
  - Transactional isolation: modifies RTL inside uniquely generated shadow
    directories (`/tmp/mantis-shadow-[id]/`) or creates temporary file backups
    (`target.sv.bak-[id]`), restoring baseline state upon completion (using
    `try...finally` rollback mechanisms).
  - Reuses the existing `append_patch.py` script once created.

## Instructions

Fix successfully reproduced design bugs without breaking correct RTL behavior or
timing intent.

Execute the patching and verification stage as follows:

1. **Load Findings to Patch:** Read the JSON files in the `workspace/findings/`
   directory. Filter for findings where `patch_status` is NOT
   `"VERIFIED_SECURE"` AND the finding is `"VALID"` or `"PROVISIONALLY_VALID"`
   with a production viability of `"VIABLE"`, `"SAMPLE_OR_TEST"`, or
   `"CONDITIONAL_VIABLE"`. Because recreation is best-effort and non-blocking, do
   **not** require `repro_status` to be `"reproduced"`: also accept findings
   whose recreation was attempted but unsuccessful (`"failed_to_reproduce"` or
   `"not_attempted"`) and bug chains (e.g., the title starts with `"Bug Chain:"`,
   or history has an entry from the `"chainer"` stage, or the
   `"constituent_findings"` property is present and non-empty). If none exist,
   emit a result footer with "status": "skipped" and stop (see schema.json,
   "Harness Result Contract").

2. **Generate and Apply Minimal Patches:** For each reproduced design bug:

   - **Target Agnosticism (Netlist vs Source):** If the target is RTL source,
     proceed with generating and applying an HDL patch as described below. If the
     target is a gate-level/post-synthesis netlist or an encrypted IP block
     without RTL source available, **do not attempt to edit the netlist or write
     netlist-patching scripts**. Instead, skip the transactional
     isolation/modification/diff steps and generate a general, high-level
     recommendation for how this issue could be mitigated at the RTL/spec level
     (e.g., "add a two-flop synchronizer on this crossing", "gate this register
     write behind the config lock bit"). Output this mitigation string in place
     of the `patch_diff` field and record `patch_status` as
     `"MITIGATION_PROPOSED"` (a mitigation was proposed but could not be
     empirically confirmed).

   - **Bug Chains:** If the finding is a bug chain (identified by `"Bug Chain:"`
     in the title, or history details, or if the `"constituent_findings"`
     property is present and non-empty), do **not** generate an HDL patch or
     diff. Instead, identify its sub-findings by reading the
     `"constituent_findings"` array of UUIDs. Monitor the patch status of these
     constituent findings (listed on disk as `workspace/findings/<uuid>.json`).
     **Important:** Defer evaluating bug chains until all individual findings in
     the batch have been processed, so that the latest patch statuses of their
     constituents are available on disk.

     Evaluate the bug chain status using these propagation rules (evaluated in
     order):

     1. **Validity Check:** Read the validity `"status"` of each constituent
        finding. If any constituent's `"status"` is `"FALSE_POSITIVE"`, update
        the bug chain finding's `"status"` to match it (e.g. `"FALSE_POSITIVE"`)
        and immediately skip any further patching/verification for the chain. If
        any constituent's `"status"` is `"DUPLICATE"`, resolve it to its
        canonical finding by recursively following its `"duplicate_of"` property.

        **Duplicate Resolution Process:**

        1. **Locate the Finding File:** The finding file for the duplicate (or
           any parent in the duplicate chain) may have been moved. Search for
           `<uuid>.json` in the following locations in order:
           - `workspace/findings/<uuid>.json` (active findings)
           - `workspace/findings/.trash/<uuid>.json` (de-duplicated trash)
           - `workspace/archive/findings_pass_*/<uuid>.json` or
             `workspace/archive/loop*_findings/<uuid>.json` (archives from
             previous passes) If the file cannot be found in any of these
             locations, treat it as a missing file error.
        2. **Cycle Detection:** Maintain a set of visited finding UUIDs during
           the resolution. If you encounter a UUID that has already been visited
           in the current resolution chain, raise a validation error (cycle
           detected).
        3. **Maximum Depth:** Limit the recursion depth to a maximum of 5 steps.
           If the chain is deeper, abort and report an error.
        4. **Extract Status:** Once you resolve to the canonical finding (one
           whose `"status"` is not `"DUPLICATE"` or does not have
           `"duplicate_of"`), use that canonical finding's `"status"` and
           `"patch_status"` for all downstream checks and propagation. Do not
           update the bug chain finding itself to `"DUPLICATE"`.

     2. **Missing Files:** If any constituent finding's JSON file is missing from
        the disk, set the chain's `"patch_status"` to `"ERROR"`.

     3. **Constituent Unset (Pending):** If any constituent's `"patch_status"` is
        unset (null or missing, indicating it has not yet been
        recreated/processed), the chain's `"patch_status"` must remain unset
        (null or missing) and you must defer/suspend further evaluation of the
        chain.

     4. **Constituent Errors:** If any constituent's `"patch_status"` is
        `"ERROR"`, set the chain's `"patch_status"` to `"ERROR"`.

     5. **Constituent Failures:** If any constituent's `"patch_status"` is
        `"VERIFICATION_FAILED"`, set the chain's `"patch_status"` to
        `"VERIFICATION_FAILED"`.

     6. **Successful Propagation:** If all constituents have finished
        verification (each is `"VERIFIED_SECURE"`), set the chain's
        `"patch_status"` to `"VERIFIED_SECURE"`.

     Skip isolation, testing, and re-verification steps for the chain finding
     itself.

   - **Chisel / Generator Targets:** If the target is a Chisel/Scala generator,
     patch the **`.scala` generator source**, never the emitted Verilog (a fix to
     generated RTL would be overwritten on the next elaboration). Keep the fix
     idiomatic Chisel (e.g., wrap a crossing in the correct
     `withClock`/`AsyncQueue`, add the missing default connect, correct a width
     or `:=` truncation, or add the lock-bit gate). Re-elaborate with `sbt`
     before verifying so the post-patch run exercises the regenerated hardware.

   - *Optional Parallel Trajectory Search:* If your framework supports subagents,
     you may spawn multiple concurrent subagents to design diverse fix
     implementations. Test all generated patches that successfully close the bug
     without breaking correct functionality, and select the *best* patch (e.g.,
     the most minimal, readable, and idiomatic fix that respects timing and reset
     intent) rather than just the first one that works.

   - Read the original flawed file to grasp module dependencies, clock/reset
     domains, and structure.

   - Design a minimal, correct RTL patch to close the bug (e.g., adding a
     multi-flop synchronizer on an async crossing, adding a reset to a critical
     register, gating a write behind a lock bit, adding a `default` arm to a
     `case`, correcting a bit-width or sign extension, or breaking a
     combinational loop) without breaking other behavior or introducing timing
     hazards.

   - **Transactional Isolation (VCS-Agnostic & Safe):** To ensure safety,
     reliability, and VCS-agnosticism, do NOT use VCS-based branch operations
     (such as `git branch`, `git checkout`, or `git stash`).

     You must ensure transactional isolation using a method appropriate for the
     operating environment. You may choose **Option A: Temporary Directory
     Shadowing** (recommended), **Option B: File-Level Backups**, or
     design/implement **Option C: Alternative Isolation** (e.g., namespace
     isolation, container volumes, or local isolated environments) as long as it
     fully satisfies the invariants below.

     Whichever method you choose, you must guarantee these invariants:

     1. **Zero Workspace Pollution**: No backup or intermediate build files left
        in the original source tree.
     2. **Concurrency Safety**: Isolation methods must not conflict with other
        concurrent agents.
     3. **Guaranteed Rollback**: Wrap all actions in error traps or
        `try...finally` blocks to restore the original state on failure.

     - **Option A: Temporary Directory Shadowing (Recommended)**

       - **Warning/Resource constraint:** For source trees larger than a few
         hundred MB, or when many parallel patch workers share the host, prefer
         **Option B** (which touches only the modified files) to avoid exhausting
         `/tmp` or memory.

       - Copy the target directory or relevant RTL source tree to a uniquely
         generated temporary location (e.g., `/tmp/mantis-shadow-[finding_id]/`
         or via `mktemp -d`).

       - Perform all edits, elaboration, and reproduction testing inside this
         temporary shadow directory.

       - **Critical Guard (Path and Working Directory Safety):** You must ensure
         that every command executed (elaboration, simulation, formal,
         verification) runs with its working directory (`Cwd`) explicitly set to
         the shadow directory. If the finding's `run_command` contains absolute
         paths to the original workspace, you must rewrite them to point to the
         corresponding paths in the shadow directory before execution.

         **Guard Check:** When performing path rewriting, only rewrite paths that
         represent the target RTL source files. If a path starts with or contains
         `<original_workspace>/workspace/` (where the Mantis state and findings
         are stored), do NOT replace its prefix with the shadow directory path
         (as findings/states must remain in the authoritative original
         workspace). Do not execute any modification or verification commands
         against the original workspace.

       - Generate the unified patch diff by comparing the original source files
         in the workspace with the modified files in the shadow directory.

       - Delete the temporary shadow directory completely when finished.

     - **Option B: File-Level Backups (Fallback)**

       - **Concurrency & Exclusivity Warning:** Because Option B modifies files
         directly in the original workspace, it is concurrency-unsafe when run in
         parallel with other workspace-modifying agents. Sequential execution
         must be strictly enforced via locking.
       - **Exclusive Workspace Lock:** Before performing backups or edits, the
         agent **must** acquire an exclusive lock on
         `workspace/.workspace_edit.lock` (using `fcntl.flock` with
         `fcntl.LOCK_EX` in Python, or a similar system-level lock). The agent
         **must** hold this lock continuously throughout the entire patching,
         verification, re-verification, and restoration lifecycle for the
         finding, releasing it only when final baseline files are restored or
         finalized.
       - **Pre-execution Check:** Prior to editing, scan the workspace for
         pre-existing backup files matching the current finding's ID (e.g.,
         `*.bak-[current_finding_id]`). If found, restore and delete them.
       - **Create Backups:** For every source file you intend to modify, create a
         copy with a unique suffix (e.g.,
         `cp target.sv target.sv.bak-[finding_id]`).
       - **Net-New Files:** Track any newly created files to delete them on
         rollback.
       - **Apply Modifications:** Edit original target files directly.
       - **Generate Unified Diff:** Compare backup against modified file using
         labels to normalize headers (e.g.,
         `diff -u --label target.sv --label target.sv target.sv.bak-[finding_id] target.sv`).

3. **Post-Patch Verification Run:** *(Skip this step for netlist-only targets
   where no RTL patch was applied, or for best-effort findings that were never
   empirically recreated — see below)*. To confirm the patch works, re-run the
   reproducer inside your isolated simulation/formal environment. Use the exact
   `"repro_file_path"` and `"run_command"` from the reproduction entry to verify
   the patch.

   - **Cwd Enforcement:** You must execute the reproducer with the working
     directory (`Cwd`) set to the shadow directory (if using Option A). Ensure
     the command targets the copy in the shadow directory, not the original
     workspace.

   - **Best-Effort (No Reproducer Available):** Because recreation is
     best-effort, some findings reach this stage without a working reproducer
     (`repro_status` is `"failed_to_reproduce"` or `"not_attempted"`). For these
     there is nothing to empirically re-run, so do **not** claim
     `"VERIFIED_SECURE"`. Apply the same treatment as a netlist-only target: emit
     a high-level RTL/spec mitigation recommendation in the `patch_diff` field
     and record `patch_status` as `"MITIGATION_PROPOSED"` (a fix was proposed but
     could not be empirically confirmed). Skip the re-verification sub-step below.
     The finding still advances to the remaining stages.

   - **VERIFIED SECURE:** If the post-patch run no longer triggers the bug (the
     assertion holds, no `X` propagates, formal proves the property, no hang),
     the initial patch holds. However, you must now perform a **Re-verification**:
     assume the patch is incomplete and explicitly attempt to write a new
     reproducer variant (a different stimulus, corner-case timing, or formal
     property) that reaches the same root cause despite your patch. Only if the
     re-verification also fails to re-trigger the bug should you mark the patch as
     fully successful! To ensure true independence, launch a fresh
     `@mantis-reproduce --reverify` subagent against the patched RTL to perform
     this re-verification.

     **Important:** When calling the `@mantis-reproduce` subagent:

     - If using **Option A (Shadowing)**, pass `--target_root=<shadow_directory>`
       (where `<shadow_directory>` is the unique temporary directory you created)
       and `--state_root=<original_workspace>` (your active workspace path). Also
       pass `--finding_id=[finding_id]` of the finding being verified.
     - If using **Option B (Backups)** or **Option C (Alternative)**, pass both
       roots pointing to the original workspace (or leave them default `.`), and
       pass `--finding_id=[finding_id]`.

     The reproducer agent running with `--reverify` will write its outcomes
     directly into the primary finding's `reverify_status`, `reverify_file_path`,
     `reverify_run_command`, and `reverify_output` fields inside the original
     workspace findings (`state_root/workspace/findings/`), keeping the initial
     `repro_*` fields untouched.

   - **VERIFICATION FAILED:** If the run still triggers the bug, or if your
     re-verification re-triggers the bug despite your patch, the patch is
     insufficient. Re-evaluate and adapt your fix.

4. **Extract Patch and Rollback Transaction:** *(Skip this step for netlist-only
   targets)*. Do not leave the design in an altered state. Once you have a final
   outcome (either `VERIFIED_SECURE` or you have exhausted your retries):

   - If successful, generate a unified diff representing your exact changes and
     save it to the `"patch_diff"` field:
     - If using **Option A (Shadowing)**, generate this diff by comparing the
       original files in the workspace with the modified files in the shadow
       directory.
     - If using **Option B (Backups)**, generate this diff by comparing the
       backup file to the modified file, explicitly labeling the headers to
       prevent the backup suffix from appearing (e.g.,
       `diff -u --label target.sv --label target.sv target.sv.bak-[finding_id] target.sv`).
     - If using **Option C (Alternative)**, generate a clean, VCS-agnostic
       unified diff comparing the unmodified baseline files to the final patched
       files.
     - If multiple files were modified, generate individual unified diffs and
       concatenate them cleanly into the single `"patch_diff"` string. Do NOT use
       VCS-specific diff commands.
   - **Transactional Clean Up / Rollback**: Restore the design to its original
     state.
     - If using **Option A (Shadowing)**, delete the temporary shadow directory
       completely (`rm -rf /tmp/mantis-shadow-[finding_id]`). Since the original
       design was never modified, no further restoration is needed.
     - If using **Option B (Backups)**, restore the original files by copying the
       backup files back onto the target files (e.g.,
       `cp target.sv.bak-[finding_id] target.sv`), delete the backup copies
       (`rm target.sv.bak-[finding_id]`), and delete any net-new files created
       during the patching process. **Do NOT delete any re-verification or
       reproducer script files written inside the `workspace/reproducers/`
       directory, any helper scripts written inside the `workspace/helpers/`
       directory, or the memory database file `workspace/learnings.jsonl`; these
       must be explicitly preserved.**
     - If using **Option C (Alternative)**, execute the corresponding teardown or
       rollback steps to fully purge all modification artifacts, delete any
       temporary resources, and ensure the original workspace is left in its
       clean baseline state.

5. **Append to Long-Term Memory (Continuous Reviewing Link):** For each design
   bug processed, append a single structured JSON line to a workspace database
   file named `workspace/learnings.jsonl` (using append mode). This allows the
   strategist (`/mantis-plan`) to read these historical records in subsequent
   passes and avoid proposing fixes for already patched files.

   - **Memory Entry Format:**
     `{"title": "[design_bug_title]", "code_paths": ["[path1:line1]"], "status": "[VERIFIED_SECURE / MITIGATION_PROPOSED / VERIFICATION_INCOMPLETE / VERIFICATION_FAILED / ERROR]"}`

6. **Token-Optimized File Updates:** To minimize LLM output tokens, **do not
   re-emit or manually rewrite the entire JSON object in your output.** Instead,
   write a reusable helper script (e.g., `workspace/helpers/append_patch.py`)
   during your first finding update. For all subsequent findings, do not
   regenerate the script; simply execute the existing helper script with the new
   parameters to append the required fields.

   You must append the following to the existing object:

   - A `"patch_status"` field (e.g., `"VERIFIED_SECURE"`,
     `"MITIGATION_PROPOSED"`, `"VERIFICATION_INCOMPLETE"`,
     `"VERIFICATION_FAILED"`, or `"ERROR"`).
   - If a patch was successful, a `"patch_diff"` field containing the unified
     diff.
   - If a re-verification was performed, the `"reverify_status"`,
     `"reverify_file_path"`, `"reverify_run_command"`, and `"reverify_output"`
     fields.
   - An entry to the `"history"` array:

   ```json
   {
     "stage": "patch",
     "action": "patched",
     "details": "Patch status evaluated as [VERIFIED_SECURE/MITIGATION_PROPOSED/VERIFICATION_INCOMPLETE/VERIFICATION_FAILED/ERROR]",
     "pass_number": <current_pass_number>,
     "timestamp": "<current_iso8601_timestamp>"
   }
   ```

When complete, emit the Harness Result Contract footer as the final part of your response (see schema.json, "Harness Result Contract").
