description: >-
  Analyzes the RTL design's version control system (VCS) history to extract past design bugs, RTL fixes, and recurring failure patterns.
  Use as an initial pre-processing step to build a historical bug database (workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl) that informs subsequent stages about past issues and fixes.
  Don't use for RTL reviews, writing testbenches, or patching HDL.

# History Analyzer (/mantis-history)

## System Goal

Historical Design-Bug Extractor. Analyzes the RTL design's version control
system (VCS) history to extract past design bugs, functional and security-related
RTL fixes, and the modules they touched, creating a historical learnings database
to inform downstream skills.

## Command Definition

- **Command:** `/mantis-history`
- **Description:** Analyzes the design's version control system (VCS) history to
  extract past RTL bugs and fixes, producing a structured historical learnings
  file (`workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl`).

## Input/Output Contract

- **Reads**:
  - `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to track current loop pass).
  - Design directory structure and key files (to determine stack).
  - VCS history logs (commit messages, titles, diffs).
  - `mantis-summary.md` (optional, if available).
  - Internal history analysis cache (optional, if exists).
- **Writes**:
  - VCS extraction script (written on-the-fly to workspace).
  - `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl`.
  - Internal history analysis cache.
- **Preconditions**:
  - Target design and VCS logs must be accessible.
- **Idempotency Guarantee**:
  - The extraction script maintains a local cache of analyzed `revision_id`s,
    skipping any already processed commits.

## Instructions

Your task is to analyze the RTL design architecture, determine what constitutes
a design-relevant history, and write a script on-the-fly to extract and document
historical hardware bugs from the project's version control system (VCS).

Execute the history analysis stage as follows:

1. **Phase 1: Analyze the Design and Define Target History:**

   - Read existing summaries (e.g. `mantis-summary.md` if available) or quickly
     inspect the root design structure to understand the primary modules, HDLs
     (Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL, or Chisel/Scala generators), and core IP
     blocks.
   - Determine what types of historical design bugs (e.g., clock-domain crossing
     (CDC) violations, reset issues, FSM deadlocks, X-propagation, register
     access-control/lock-bit flaws, arithmetic overflow, bit-width truncation,
     or others) are relevant to this design and what keywords or commits should
     be targeted.

2. **Phase 2: Write a History Extraction Script:**

   - Read the active pass number from the state file
     `workspace/.mantis_state.json` and resolve the current ISO 8601 timestamp.
   - Write a script (e.g. Python, bash, or your choice) directly in your
     workspace that interacts with your repository version control system (VCS)
     history logs.
   - **Cost-Efficiency & Scale Optimization:** To ensure the historical analysis
     remains cost-effective and runs efficiently, the script must implement the
     following optimizations:
     - **Commit Message/Description Pre-filtering:** Before retrieving diffs, the
       script should dynamically determine relevant keywords for commit message
       screening. It can do this by first inspecting the design's files and
       HDLs/domains in scope to establish its primary stack (e.g. RTL/gate-level
       versus verification/testbench), then either querying an LLM/analysis
       agent for a tailored list of bug/hazard keywords (e.g. "CDC",
       "metastability", "glitch", "deadlock", "reset", "overflow", "off-by-one",
       "X-prop", "sensitivity list", "latch") or using a broader set of keywords
       augmented with these specific domain terms. Skip revisions whose messages
       or titles do not match these relevant keywords to avoid unnecessarily
       retrieving and analyzing changesets that are irrelevant to the design in
       scope.
     - **Diff Filtering and Size Limits:** Ignore commits that only touch
       non-synthesizable code (e.g., testbenches, documentation, or build
       scripts) unless they reveal a real RTL bug. Skip commits with excessively
       large diffs (e.g., more than several thousand lines changed), as they are
       usually automated formatting changes or massive
       refactorings/re-parameterizations rather than discrete bug fixes.
     - **Caching Results:** The script should maintain a local cache (e.g., in a
       JSON or SQLite file) mapping `revision_id` to whether it was analyzed. If
       a revision has already been processed and cached, skip it. This makes
       repeated historical analyses instant and zero-cost.
     - **Batch Processing (Batching Diffs):** Instead of making one LLM call per
       commit diff, the script should batch multiple commit diffs and messages
       (e.g. 3 to 5 commits) into a single LLM call. Ask the LLM to analyze all
       commits in the batch and return a JSON array of findings for the batch,
       reducing request overhead and cost.
     - **Model Selection:** Use lightweight and cost-efficient models for the
       initial commit analysis/filtering, and only fall back to heavier model
       tiers if deeper verification of a suspected design bug is needed.
   - **Detailed Analysis:** For revisions or commits that look design-relevant,
     the script should retrieve the commit diffs and messages/change
     descriptions.
   - **LLM/Agent Analysis:** The script should make API calls (e.g., via
     subagent messages or Agent API subcommands) or use an LLM subagent to
     analyze the changes' diffs and messages to determine whether a
     revision/commit was a bug fix, what module was affected, the bug class,
     impact, and the fix diff. Make sure it uses batching and caching to
     minimize API calls.
   - **Missing Information:** Do not overindex on the lack of bug-related
     keywords. Many RTL bugs are fixed without formal tracking, and many design
     flaws are corrected without the author realizing they were exploitable or
     silicon-affecting.
   - **Output Format:** Instruct your script to output the extracted findings
     into a JSONL file named `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl`, matching
     the following format:

### Historical Learnings Schema Format (`workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl`)

```json
{
  "revision_id": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "code_paths": ["module.sv:line_number"],
  "bug_type": "...",
  "mitigation_diff": "...",
  "tracking_id": "...",
  "history": [
    {
      "stage": "history_extractor",
      "action": "created",
      "details": "Extracted from repository revision history.",
      "pass_number": <current_pass_number>,
      "timestamp": "<current_iso8601_timestamp>"
    }
  ]
}
```

1. **Phase 3: Execute and Verify:**
   - Run the script you just wrote to analyze the VCS history, process
     revisions, and generate the `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl` file.
   - Wait for the script to finish and verify that
     `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl` has been written successfully and
     contains extracted data.

When complete, emit the Harness Result Contract footer as the final part of your response (see schema.json, "Harness Result Contract").
